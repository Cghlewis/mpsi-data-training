<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>This module is about connecting all of the pieces of the puzzle and
thinking about how we can move from simply knowing what good data
management <em>should</em> look like, to planning how you will actually
manage data in your lab, for your projects, and with your team.</p>
<p>For the most part, the modules in this website have discussed phases
of data management and best practices as independent steps in the data
management life cycle. Yet we know very well, that all of these phases
are dependent and connected. Before we begin to choose which practices
to implement, we need to be able to put practices in context of outcomes
(what are the benefits of implementing different practices). We then
move on to review the data management and research life cycle to better
understand how each module fits into the larger process. Then, we talk
about <em>when</em> to start choosing the practices you want to
implement, and provide checklists as tools to use in the planning
process. And last, we talk about putting it all together by creating a
data management workflow that works for you.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="importance-of-best-practices" class="section level2">
<h2>Importance of best practices</h2>
<hr />
<p>While there are MANY reasons to implement good data management
practices (ex: funder requirements, legal and ethical mandates,
contributing to open science, etc.), I think we can boil the benefits of
data management down to 3 basic outcomes. Good data management produces
<strong>reproducible</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong>, and
<strong>secure</strong> data for you and future users.</p>
<p>Let’s connect these outcomes to actions that we have covered in
previous modules:</p>
<p><strong>Reproducible</strong></p>
<p>Reproducible is defined as being able to produce the same results
using the same materials and procedure. This could be anything from
reproducing a data collection effort to reproducing a clean data
file.</p>
<p>Data Management practices that contribute to reproducibility
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_1.html">Documentation</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_3.html">Style
Guide</a></li>
<li><a

Cleaning Plan</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_4.html#Reproducible_syntax">Syntax
Writing</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliable</strong></p>
<p>Reliable data is accurate/true and complete data that you can trust.
Unreliable data might include problems such as inaccurately entered
data, incorrectly coded variables, or missing values, and can lead to
inaccurate decision making.</p>
<p>Practices that contribute to reliable data include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_2.html#Data_Collection_Instruments">Creation
of data collection tools using data dictionaries</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_2.html#Participant_Database">Participant
tracking</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_2.html#Data_Entry">Double
entry of physical data</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_1.html#Miscellaneous">Versioning
of data and code</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_4.html#Data_cleaning_steps">Validity
checks</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secure</strong></p>
<p>Data security involves storing and sharing data in a way that
protects participant confidentiality as well as prevents loss of
information.</p>
<p>Practices that contribute to data security include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_2.html#Data_Storage">Storing
paper and electronic data according to your IRB and DCL Rules</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_2.html#Data_Storage">De-identifying
data</a></li>

<div id="research-life-cycle" class="section level2">
<h2>Research Life Cycle</h2>
<hr />
<p>We touched on the research life cycle in the <a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_0.html#Project_Life_Cycle">Project
Management module</a>. However, I think it’s important now that we have
gone through best practices, to put them all into context of where they
fit in the data management life cycle.</p>
<p>Below we have a research life cycle image that shows how data
management and project coordination work in parallel and collaboratively
throughout a study. I typically think of the project
management/coordination path as consisting of the PI/Co-PI as well as
the project coordinator, and any other staff in charge of implementing
the project as well as any intervention. The data management path
consists of anyone in charge of working with data or data products (such
as documentation or data collection tools), and again could still
include PIs/Co-PIs, project coordinators, data managers and any other
staff working with data. Sometimes the project team and the data team
are the same people (especially if the team is small). Either way, it is
still helpful to see how these paths work simultaneously and
collaboratively.</p>
<p><img src="img/cl_lifecycle.PNG" /></p>
<p>Moving from left to right:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In a typical study we first begin by generating ideas, deciding what
we want to study.</li>
<li>Then, most likely, we will look for funding to implement that study.
This is where the two paths begin to diverge. If the team is applying
for federal funding, the proposal and budget are created in the project
management track, while the 2-5 page required data management plan (DMP)
is created in the data track. Again, it may be the same people working
on both of these pieces.</li>
<li>Next, if the project is funded, the project team will begin planning
things such as hiring, recruitment, data collection, and how to
implement the intervention. At the same time, those working on the data
team will begin to plan out how to specifically implement the 2-5 page
DMP submitted to their funder and start putting any necessary structures
into place.</li>
<li>Once planning is complete, the team moves into the cycle of data
collection. It is called a cycle because if your study is longitudinal,
every step here will occur cyclically. Once one phase of data collection
wraps up, the team re-enters the cycle again for the next phase of data
collection, until all data collection is complete for the entire
project.
<ul>
<li>The data management and project management team begin the cycle by
starting documentation. You can see that this phase occurs
collaboratively because it is denoted with a double outline. Both teams
begin developing documentation like data dictionaries, style guides, and
protocols.</li>
<li>Once documentation is started, both teams begin to create any
necessary data collection instruments. These instruments will be created
with input from the documentation. During this phase the team may also
develop their participant tracking database.</li>
<li>Next, the project management team moves into the data collection
phase. This may involve recruitment and consenting, as well as data
collection. At this point, the data management team just provides
support as needed.</li>
<li>As data is collected, the project team will track data as it is
collected in the participant tracking database. The data management team
will collaborate with the project management team to help troubleshoot
anything related to the actual tracking database.</li>
<li>Next, once data is collected, the teams move into the data capture
phase. This is where teams are actively retrieving or converting data.
For electronic data this may look like downloading data from a platform
or having data sent to the team via a secure transfer. For physical
data, this may look like teams entering paper data into a database.
Oftentimes, this again is a collaborative effort between the project
management team and the data team.</li>
<li>Once the data is captured, it needs to be stored. While the data
team may be in charge of setting up and monitoring the storage efforts,
the project team may be the ones actively retrieving and storing the
data.</li>
<li>Next the teams move into the cleaning and validation phase. At this
time the data team is reviewing data cleaning plans, writing data
cleaning scripts and actively cleaning data from the most recent data
collection round.</li>
<li>And last, the data team will version data as it is updated or errors
are found.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The teams then only move out of the active data collection phase
when all data collection for the project is complete. At this time the
project team begins analyzing study data and working on publications.
They are able to do this because of the organized processes implemented
during the data collection cycle. Since data was managed and cleaned
throughout, data is ready for analysis as soon as data collection is
complete. Then, while the project team is analyzing data, the data team
is doing any additional preparation to archive data for public
sharing.</li>
<li>Last, the team submits data for public sharing.</li>
</ol>

<div id="planning-data-management" class="section level2">
<h2>Planning Data Management</h2>
<hr />
<p>Data management planning is <strong>the most</strong> important step
you can implement in the data management life cycle. Data management
planning is the catalyst for reaping all of the benefits mentioned
above. Without planning, the chances of inconsistencies, lost data, and
human errors increase greatly. Think about a project where data is
collected inconsistently, files are saved haphazardly, data cleaning is
not well documented, and data is stored and shared without rules for
security. It sounds like the story line of a data management horror
narrative.</p>
<p>We saw in our data management flow chart above, that data management
planning is mentioned twice. First it is mentioned in the context of a
data management plan (DMP), the 2-5 page document required by federal
funders that we reviewed in <a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_5.html#Why_Share_Data">Module
5</a>. And while DMPs provide a hopeful guide for future practices,
there is often a disconnect between the broad theory behind those plans
and the actual complex implementation of those plans in practice (<a
href="https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2021-009/">Borycz,
2021</a>). This is when the second planning phase comes into play.
Planning data management refers to making detailed decisions and
creating actionable steps to implement your DMP. This data management
planning happens at the same time that the project team is planning for
project implementation (things like how to collect data, how to hire
staff, planning supplies, how to recruit participants, how to
communicate with sites, etc).</p>
<div id="checklists" class="section level3">
<h3>Checklists</h3>
<p>Planning checklists can be really useful in helping you remember the
various data management decisions that need to be made before your
project begins. Below are checklists broken out by each phase. While
these checklists will not encompass everything that every project will
need to consider, it is a jumping off point for starting these team
discussions. When reviewing these checklists, take into consideration
all the variations that are unique to your team and project such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Requirements of your funder
<ul>
<li>What did you say you would do in your DMP? Make sure to follow your
DMP (or revise your DMP to match your new decisions - remember your DMP
is a living document).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Requirements of your IRB
<ul>
<li>What data security requirements are set forth by your IRB? What data
collection restrictions/allowances are given by your IRB?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The skill level of your team
<ul>
<li>Does your team have the skill set to implement the practices you
plan to implement or will some additional training be needed?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Available tools
<ul>
<li>What tools are available to your team? Does your
organization/university only allow you to use certain platforms for data
storage? What is the complexity of your tools? Will additional training
be needed?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Budget constraints
<ul>
<li>Do you have the budget to implement all of the practices you want to
implement or will you need to plan something more feasible?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The complexity of your project
<ul>
<li>The size of your project, the amount and types of data you are
collecting, the number of participants or the populations you are
collecting data from, the sensitivity level of the data you are
collecting, the number of sites you are collecting data at, and the
number of partners and decision makers you are working with, all factor
into your data management planning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpersonal skills
<ul>
<li>Believe it or not, implementing good data management requires really
good interpersonal skills. Your team needs to be able to communicate
openly and clearly with each other and with external partners in order
to plan and implement sometimes very nuanced and complex processes to
keep your data organized. Knowing how well your team communicates and
works together will help you as you plan for the best structures that
fit within your team culture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Buy-in
<ul>
<li>You need to know your team’s buy-in. If your team cannot get on
board with your vision for improving data management, it’s going to be
very difficult to not have mistakes start creeping in very quickly
because the motivation to keep implementing good practices just won’t be
there. Knowing the buy-in level of your team is very important when
planning for data management and anticipating possible future
mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<div id="checklist-templates" class="section level4">
<h4>Checklist Templates</h4>
<p>Note that many of these checklists will occur alongside (or may
overlap with) general project planning which should have their own set

</div>
<div id="workflows" class="section level3">
<h3>Workflows</h3>
<p>Another part of the planning phase is developing data management
workflows.</p>
<p>A workflow, often illustrated with a flow diagram, is a series of
repeatable tasks that help you move through the stages of the research
life cycle in an “organized and efficient manner” (<a
href="https://library.csp.edu/c.php?g=929514&amp;p=6724401">Concordia-Saint
Paul</a>). A workflow is personalized. It is where you start to choose
which “best practices” work for your project and your team. One team may
collect survey data on paper because their participants are young
children, hand enter it into Excel because it is the tool their team is
familiar with, and double enter 20% because they don’t have the capacity
to enter more than that. Another team may collect paper data because
they are collecting data in the field, hand enter the data into
FileMaker because that is the only tool they have access to, and double
enter 100% because they have the budget and capacity to do that.</p>
<p><a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/72kcw990/release/1">Borghi
and Van Gulick</a> view a workflow as a series of steps that a research
team chooses, out of a the many possibilities not chosen. Maybe you
won’t always be able to implement the “best practices” but you can
decide what is good enough for your team based on motivations,
incentives, needs, resources, skill set, and rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Here is a very simplified example of the decision making process,
based on the <a
href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/72kcw990/release/1">Borghi and
Van Gulick</a> flow chart. Of course in real life we are often choosing
between many more than just 2 options!</p>

<h4>How to create a workflow</h4>
<p>Your checklists are guides for what decisions need to be made. As you
walk through your checklists, you can begin to enter your decisions into
a workflow diagram. The order of your steps should follow the general
order of the data management life cycle (specifically the data
collection cycle). You will want to have a workflow diagram for every
piece of data that you collect. So for example, if you collect the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student paper survey</li>
<li>Student online assessment</li>
<li>Student district level administrative data</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have 3 workflow diagrams for these 3 processes.</p>
<p>Your diagrams should include the <strong>who</strong>,
<strong>what</strong>, <strong>where</strong>, and <strong>when</strong>
of each task/step in the process.</p>
<p>Your diagram can be displayed in any format that works for you. Here
are a few examples of workflow diagrams.</p>

<p>And while all of these diagrams are good jumping off points, I think
an effective diagram really needs to call out (at least minimally) the
who, what, where, and when of each task. I think a template like this
one below works very well. Remember, this is a repeatable process. So
while this diagram is linear (steps laid out in the order in which we
expect them to happen), this process will be repeated
<strong>every</strong> time we collect this same piece of data.</p>
<p><img src="img/workflow4.PNG" /></p>

<p>Here is how I might complete this diagram for a student survey.</p>

<div id="benefits-to-visualizing-a-workflow" class="section level4">
<h4>Benefits to visualizing a workflow</h4>
<p>Visualizing these decisions in diagram format has many benefits.
First it allows your team to see how their roles and responsibilities
fit into the larger research process. Also, showing how data management
is integrated into the larger research workflow can help team members
view data management as part of their daily routine, rather than “extra
work”. And last, reviewing workflows as a team and allowing members to
provide feedback can help create buy-in for data management process.</p>
</div>
<div id="putting-your-workflow-into-a-protocol" class="section level4">
<h4>Putting your workflow into a protocol</h4>
<p>While these workflow diagrams are excellent for high level views of
what the process will be, we can easily see that we are unable to put
fine details into this visual diagram.</p>
<p>So the last step of creating a workflow, is to put all steps into a
protocol. In your protocol you will add all necessary details of the
process. You can also attach your visual diagram as an addendum to the
protocol for reference.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how I might translate the student survey
workflow from above, into a detailed protocol. Notice that I mention
that I have a <strong>separate</strong> protocol just for the data
cleaning portion of this workflow (and this might be because the data
cleaning workflow is the same workflow used across many different types
of data).</p>
<p>**NOTE: All workflows should be written into protocols, yet all
protocols are not created from workflows. Sometimes protocols are simply
documentation of decisions that are made. Take for example, a protocol
on how study IDs will be assigned, or a protocol for inclusion/exclusion
criteria. These don’t require workflows necessarily, yet they still need
to be documented in a protocol.</p>

<div id="workflow-considerations" class="section level4">
<h4>Workflow considerations</h4>
<p>Similar to the questions you need to consider when reviewing your
planning checklists. You also need to evaluate the following things when
developing your workflow.</p>
<p>✔️ Does your flow preserve the integrity of your data? Is there any
point where you might lose or comprise data?<br />
✔️ Is there any point in the flow where data is not being handled
securely? Someone gains access to identifiable information that should
not have access?<br />
✔️ Is your flow in accordance with all of your compliance requirements
(IRB, FERPA, HIPAA, etc.)?<br />
✔️ Is your flow feasible for your team (based on size, skill level,
motivation, etc.)?<br />
✔️ Is your flow feasible for your budget and available resources?<br />
✔️ Is your flow feasible for the amount and types of data you are
collecting?<br />
✔️ Are there any bottlenecks in the workflow? Areas where resources or
training are needed? Any areas where tasks should be re-directed?</p>

<h2>Last Thoughts</h2>
<hr />
<p>Data management is complicated and the concepts can feel nebulous at
times. At a lot of what works great for one team, may not work at all
for another. Or even what works great for one round of data collection,
may not work great for the next round. Things change: staff, situations,
data, tools, life events, etc. Everything that is suggested in this
entire series is just that, suggestions. They are ways that may help you
get closer to having a better data management process than you had in
your previous project, or in the last year of your current project, or
even in the last week. By now I think we’ve all learned that data
management is important. How we get to well-managed data doesn’t have to
be through the same means and it doesn’t have to be implementing
<strong>everything</strong> mentioned in this series. Ultimately, if you
care about data management, if you are taking time to plan and think
through your processes, if you are documenting those processes, and you
are able to get your team on board with those processes, I call that a
win!</p>
