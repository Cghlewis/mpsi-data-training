ðŸ”² What original data are we collecting?
  
  - Qualitative, quantitative, both?
  - What measures?

ðŸ”² Does this project require IRB approval? 

  - Who is ensuring that data collection scales/measures are compliant and approved?

ðŸ”² What instruments are we using to collect original data?

  - Surveys, observations, assessments, measurements, interviews, focus groups, and so on
  
**For each instrument, answer the following questions**

ðŸ”² What data are we collecting with that instrument?

  - What exact scales/measures are collected by this instrument?
  - What items make up those scales/measures?
  - What are the value options/range of each item?
  - What are the variable types of each item? 
  - How will these items be transformed after being collected? (ex: recoded, scored)
  - Do we have all of this information documented in a data dictionary?
  
ðŸ”² What tools are we using to collect this data?

  - Online platforms, handheld devices, paper, and so on
  - Have we considered all barriers associated with this tool? (ex: no internet access in data collection sites)

ðŸ”² Who is ensuring that data collection tools are compliant with rules and regulations??

ðŸ”² Are there any costs associated with our data collection tools?

  - What purchases are needed? (supplies, subscriptions, etc.)
  
ðŸ”² Who is building the data collection instrument in this tool?

  - Do they have the expertise to use this tool?
  - Is additional training needed?
  
ðŸ”² What do we need to consider when building this data collection instrument in this tool?  

  - How will we use this tool to collect data? (in person data collectors, email links, etc.)
  - How will we uniquely identify participants in our instruments?
  - How will data errors be prevented in our instruments?

ðŸ”² Who is testing/reviewing the instrument before collecting data?

ðŸ”² When are we collecting this data?

  - How often are we collecting data?
  - How long will each collection period last?
  
\* _Note that additional project management questions such as "who is collecting data?", "how are staff getting trained to collect data?", or "how will we schedule data collection?" are not in this checklist. Those are questions that would be added to a project management data collection checklist. While the project team and data team should plan a project collaboratively, it is helpful to delineate project coordination and data management questions to ensure everything is covered._
