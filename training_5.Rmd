## Overview

---

Data sharing has become one of the most discussed areas around data management. With the growing number of funders requesting a data sharing plan (i.e. NIH), more people want to know how and why they should share their study data. In a 2019 [paper](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/istl/index.php/istl/article/view/12), Pasek and Mayer found that data curation and re-use was cited as the area most needing improvement by graduate students across two universities. And in a way data sharing is a great jumping off point for many people to think about data management. With an end goal in mind, researchers can start to think about what structures they need to put in place to curate data that will be acceptable for data sharing.

### Funders

Almost all funders that education researchers work with now require data sharing in some form as part of their data management plan. For instance, IES states the following:

NIH new changes

Other


### Why data share

There are many reasons to share data and the number one reason may be that it is required by your funder. But outside of that, there are many other reasons to share data that benefit your line of research as well as the research community as a whole.

## Where to Share Data

---

### Repository

Why this is good: DOI and citation, metadata, assistance from repository, less maintenance on your part, forces you to be organized throughout the lifecylce of a project (if you choose the repository early on and know what is needed). Dataset versions can be recorded in a repository (if updates are made to a dataset - say an error is found).

- General 

University affliated, OSF, Zenodo

- Domain specific

LDBase, ICPSR


### Personal website

- Freely downloadable
no doi/citation and difficult to track who is using your data

- data request form
requires work on staff's part to respond
