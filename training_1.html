<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>Data documentation is not only required by funders including IES, it
is essential for data management. Data documentation should cover the
who, what, where, when, and why of your project and your data (<a
href="https://osf.io/48ufs/">OSF: NIH</a>).</p>
<p><img src="img/document2.PNG" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Documentation also allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track decisions/changes made throughout the life cycle of the
project<br />
</li>
<li>Make decisions/analyses replicable<br />
</li>
<li>Clean data with fidelity<br />
</li>
<li>Ensure others use and interpret data accurately<br />
</li>
<li>Discover errors in data<br />
</li>
<li>Allow others to find archived data through metadata</li>
<li>Reduces <a
href="https://www.teaguehenry.com/strings-not-factors/2021/1/24/data-management-for-researchers-three-terrifying-tales">data
rot</a>, when good data is transformed over time and becomes unusable
because no one tracks the transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation can take many forms. <a
href="https://ies.ed.gov/funding/datasharing_implementation.asp">IES</a>
states that they expect documentation to “be a comprehensive and
stand-alone document that includes all the information necessary to
replicate the analysis performed by the original research team” and
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a summary of the purpose of the data collection<br />
</li>
<li>methodology and procedures used to collect the data<br />
</li>
<li>timing of the data collection<br />
</li>
<li>details of the data codes, definition of variables, transformations,
variable field locations, and frequencies</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a) IES provides no template for how documentation is laid
out OR what tools to use to create/share this information and b) outside
of IES required documentation for data sharing, there may be additional
documentation your team may want to keep to help manage internal
processes.</p>
<p>This training will cover types of documentation you may want to keep.
Many of these documents have overlapping information and some terms may
be used interchangeably in the field (ex: Data dictionary and codebook
or README and metadata). Also, some of the documents are important to
start day one of the project, while others are more important to create
at the end of the project when you are ready to share data. The point of
this next section isn’t to implement all of these documents, but rather
to consider which documents capture the information you need to have a
successful project. It may just be a protocol and a data dictionary. Or
it may be a protocol, a data dictionary and a README for each data file.
Or it may be all of these documents! It depends on things such as the
scale of your project and how you plan to share the data at the end of
your project.</p>

found here:</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<div id="protocol" class="section level3">
<h3>Protocol</h3>
<p>I’ve seen this document called many other names including procedures
manual, standard operation procedures (sop), research protocol, or
coordinator’s manual. The CITI Good Clinical Practices <a
href="https://about.citiprogram.org/series/good-clinical-practice-gcp/">training</a>
calls this a Clinical Protocol. Whatever term you use, this is a
document/s to record all of your procedures and changes made to those
procedures throughout the grant.</p>
<p>At some point someone will ask you how or why you did something the
way you did. This is the document that will save you because it is very
likely that you will not remember. This document also helps standardize
your procedures. You can and should refer back to this document during a
longitudinal study to ensure you continue to implement procedures in the
same way.</p>
<p>I highly recommend always adding protocol as part of any data
documentation plan. You can make separate protocol documents per
procedure or keep them all in one standalone document with a table of
contents. Most likely your protocol will not be shared outside of your
team, but the information in your protocol can be used to inform other
documentation such as READMEs or codebooks. Your protocol can live in
any format that works for you (ex: .docx, .md, .txt, google doc, or you
can use a platform such as <a
href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a>). It is a living
document that will be continually updated so use a format that makes
sense for you. All of your project/grant specific protocols should be
housed in an easily accessible location such as the top of a project
folder.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have protocols that may be applicable across
all projects (such as rules for data entry). You can keep a copy of
these more broad rules in an institutional protocol (or some may call it
a lab manual) to be referred to for all projects and keep it in an
accessible location such as your team folder.</p>
<p>Protocol should cover procedures/decisions for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participant recruitment (inclusionary and exclusionary
decisions)</li>
<li>Consent and assent</li>
<li>Participant selection</li>
<li>Randomization and blinding/unblinding</li>
<li>Data collection</li>
<li>Staff training</li>
<li>Data entry, data retrieval, data scoring (including decision
rules)</li>
<li>Payments/incentives</li>
<li>Intervention implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>Each protocol should <em>begin</em> with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Date the protocol was made</li>
<li>Who made the protocol</li>
<li>Any rationale behind the protocol</li>
<li>Any related documents or research behind the protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be times when you need to revise your protocol, either due
to decisions made by the researchers (ex: moving surveys from paper to
online due to the pandemic) or to note deviations from the protocol
discovered during data collection (ex: data collectors were allowing
students to read assessment instructions on their own rather than
reading them out loud to the group). For any <em>changes to</em> or
<em>deviations from</em> the protocol after the project has begun, add
the following below the original protocol section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revision Date<br />
</li>
<li>Who decided on the revision<br />
</li>
<li>Any rationale behind the revision<br />
</li>
<li>Any related documents or research behind the revision</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also good practice to add a copy of your data collection
instruments to your protocol (Surveys, Interview Questions, etc.), as
well as changes/versions of those and explanations for the changes.</p>
<p>📑 These <a
href="https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Management_and_Data_Management_Plans/7890827">slides</a>
from Jessica Logan, Ph.D. have nice protocol examples.<br />
📑 This <a href="img/sample_sop.pdf">sample</a> protocol (or sop) from
CITI, while not education focused, provides a nice template for how to
lay out each individual protocol.<br />
📑 This is a cool <a
href="https://cds-snc.github.io/design-research-handbook/home/">example</a>
of an interactive research protocol housed on GitHub. You could build
something similar in a tool like Google Docs. While this one isn’t
education specific, you can see how the outline can be replaced with
education research content.</p>

<div id="style-guide" class="section level3">
<h3>Style Guide</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide">style guide</a>
is a set of standards around data management rules. It improves
consistency within and across files and projects. This document includes
conventions for procedures such as variable naming, value coding, file
naming, versioning, and file structure. Consider having a style guide
specific to every project (for variable naming, value coding) as well as
a general style guide that applies to all projects (for file structure,
versioning, and file naming). This guide can be be kept in any form such
as .txt or .pdf and should be housed where it can easily be accessed by
all team members (Ex: a style guide that applies across projects may be
kept on a wiki and a project-specific style guide may be kept as a
protocol or README in a project folder). See <a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_3.html">Training3</a>
for best practices in style guides.</p>
<p>Example <a
href="https://github.com/bartvandebiezen/file-name-conventions/blob/master/README.md">style
guide</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="wiki" class="section level3">
<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p>I am including a wiki in this list even though I think it is an
unconventional documentation tool in education research. A wiki can help
your team internally document, organize, and navigate reference
material. If you use platforms such as Microsoft SharePoint, your
default team page type is wiki and your home page can be a great place
to store information that your team frequently refers to. SharePoint
describes a wiki as “a site that is designed for groups of people to
quickly capture and share ideas by creating simple pages and linking
them together.” It is a page that anyone on your team can add/edit
content (a short blurb about the document) and then can link to those
referenced documents for easy access.</p>
<p>Wikis can be made for specific research projects and are great for
referring to frequently requested information (ex: recruitment
information or participant payment details). You can also make a general
research team wiki that includes information that either applies to your
entire team (ex: Team meeting notes or employee manual) or information
that is relevant across all projects (ex: Style guide, lab manual).</p>
<p>📑 You can make wikis with many other tools, but you can read more
about SharePoint’s wiki <a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-and-edit-a-wiki-dc64f9c2-d1a2-44b5-ac59-b9d535551a32">here</a>.</p>
<p>📑 <a
href="https://www.notion.so/guides/how-to-build-a-wiki-for-your-company">Notion</a>
is another tool I recently learned of to build a wiki as well.</p>
<p>📑 There is a great episode of the <a
href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1074286/5185513-episode-5-organizing-shared-network-drives-tips-and-tricks">Education
Data Chat</a> podcast where they discuss wikis as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="data-dictionary" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
<p>A data dictionary is another essential data management document and I
highly suggest you start this before your ever collect a piece of data.
This will help you set up successful back-end coding as you create data
collection tools and it will serve as a reference document you can use
as questions come up about the data. It is also a document that can be
shared with others to help them better understand your data. A data
dictionary is usually in rectangular format, for example an Excel
spreadsheet, Google sheet or something similar that has rows and
columns. It includes all information relevant to every variable in your
data.</p>
<p>📑 Here is a nice <a
href="https://media.screensteps.com/image_assets/assets/001/878/671/original/8fbcc565-602f-4ac6-b828-2eaaeb67578b.png">example</a>
of a very simple data dictionary.</p>
<p>Your dictionary <strong>should</strong> capture information such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable Name<br />
</li>
<li>Variable Label<br />
</li>
<li>Exact question text<br />
</li>
<li>Associated scale/measure (if the item belongs to a scale)</li>
<li>Associated form (Student survey, teacher rating of student,
etc.)</li>
<li>Value range or value codes ([1-99] or 0=No, 1=Yes)<br />
</li>
<li>Measurement unit (numeric, string, date, etc.)<br />
</li>
<li>Missing data codes</li>
<li>Variable universe (Who gets this question? Is there skip
logic?)</li>
<li>What time periods does this variable exist</li>
<li>Reverse coding</li>
<li>Calculations (composite variables, scores)</li>
<li>Notes (such as versions/changes to this variable)</li>
<li>Question number (order number of the question on the measure)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may consider having separate data dictionaries per expected final
dataset. So for example, if you plan to have a final teacher dataset and
a final student dataset, you may want to have a student dictionary and a
teacher dictionary rather than having only one data dictionary and
marking teacher or student in the universe column.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, it is important to start a data dictionary
<strong>before</strong> ever collecting data. You should be able to
begin filling in information for the data you have control over. For
example, if you are making and administering the survey, you should be
able to know what variables will be in that data, how you want to name
them, and how they should be coded. However, you may not know this
information for other variables until after data collection. For
example, if you are administering a 3rd party assessment, you may not
know what the exported data is going to look like until after you have
collected the data and it has been scored. Just remember, this is a
living document that will updated continually throughout the life of the
project.</p>
<p><strong>In order to start a data dictionary, you should gather the
following information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What measures are we collecting? (Ex: Student Assessment, Teacher
Observation, Teacher Survey, Principal Interview)</li>
<li>What are the items/scales included?</li>
<li>What is your variable naming protocol? (See <a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_3.html#Variable_Naming">variable
naming in Style Guide</a>)</li>
<li>Do your items/scales have pre-determined value coding rules or can
we assign our own? What is our value coding protocol? (See <a
href="https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_3.html#Value_Coding">value
coding in Style Guide</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s good to also consider starting to document the variables you
aren’t collecting but you are <strong>assigning</strong> or
<strong>deriving</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables you are assigning:
<ul>
<li>To maintain anonymity and to track participants and merge data over
time, you will be assigning identifiers.
<ul>
<li>Participant/Study ID (<em>stu_id</em>, <em>tch_id</em>)</li>
<li>Location/Site ID (<em>sch_id</em>, <em>dist_id</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depending on your study design you may also need to account for the
following:
<ul>
<li>Treatment/condition/intervention group (Ex: <em>int</em>)</li>
<li>Time/wave (<em>year</em>, <em>wave</em>, <em>cohort</em>)</li>
<li>Randomization blocks (<em>class</em>, <em>group</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Variables you derive:
<ul>
<li>These include things such as composite scores, weights, or
continuous variables grouped into categories. You can start to add these
variables and their calculations/logic to your data dictionary.
<ul>
<li>Ex: <em>scale_mean</em>, <em>sch_size_cat</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Quick thought: Accounting for Time</strong></p>
<p>When deciding how to account for time, consider how you plan to merge
your data across time.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

points are in that row), then append time to your variables (prefix or

<h3>Codebook</h3>
<p>Like a data dictionary, a codebook also captures variable
information, as well as project level information. It should capture all
a user would need to know in order to understand and correctly interpret
your data. It is typically part of the metadata that is added to a data
archive, or is given to those who request your data after the project is
complete. It usually takes the form of a plain text file (.txt), pdf
(.pdf), or extensible markup language (.xml), rather than a proprietary
form such as .docx. If you embed metadata into your data, such as
variable labels, value labels and missing values, several statistical
programs (including R, SPSS, SAS and Stata) will export codebooks for
your final datasets. You can make one large codebook that includes all
data for your project, or make separate codebooks by dataset (ex:
Teacher level dataset codebook), or even by measure (ex: Student survey
codebook).</p>
<p>📑 Here is a nice example of a <a
href="https://ddialliance.org/sites/default/files/06551.pdf">codebook</a>.</p>
<p>Your codebook should captures things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study title<br />
</li>
<li>Names of Investigators<br />
</li>
<li>Table of contents<br />
</li>
<li>Purpose and format of the codebook<br />
</li>
<li>Variable level details
<ul>
<li>Variable name<br />
</li>
<li>Variable label<br />
</li>
<li>Question text<br />
</li>
<li>Measurement unit</li>
<li>Coded values or value range (1,2,3,4)<br />
</li>
<li>Value labels (<em>excellent</em>, <em>good</em>, <em>fair</em>,
<em>poor</em>)<br />
</li>
<li>Summary statistics</li>
<li>Missing data values<br />
</li>
<li>Skip patterns<br />
</li>
<li>Notes<br />
</li>
<li>If data is in text format, indicate position of each variable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Computations</li>
<li>Imputations</li>
</ul>
<p>Other optional content for a codebook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citations for scales used and published reliability</li>
<li>Data collection instruments</li>
<li>Consent agreements</li>
<li>Methodological details<br />
</li>
<li>Flowchart of data collection instruments/screeners</li>
<li>Study timeline</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Last, I have found that sometimes the term data dictionary is
synonymous with codebook. I don’t think the name matters, but for the
sake of this training I am specifying a data dictionary as the document
in tabular form with only variable level information and a codebook as a
document usually in text format. You can keep either or both types of
documentation. I think the data dictionary as laid out in this training
is the easier document to update throughout the life of the project and
assists with project implementation, while I view the codebook as a
document to summarize the final datasets at the end of the project (and
to be included with data archives/requests).</em></p>

<h3>README</h3>
<p>A README is a plain text (.txt), markdown (.md), pdf (.pdf), or
extensible markup language (.xml), standalone file that explains your
files. README files are most known for their use in programming, but
have become more prevalent in research. It is recommended to make one
README file per dataset. This standalone document will accompany each
dataset. It should be named so it is easily associated with the dataset
and it should be housed in the same folder the data is in.</p>
<p>A README should capture data such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>General information (Title of dataset, contact information, key
dates, funding)</li>
<li>File information (Description, format, creation date, versions)</li>
<li>Access information (Licenses, recommended citation, associated
publications)</li>
<li>Methodology (Consent rates, data collection methods, data processing
methods, software used, quality-assurance procedures)</li>
<li>Optional: Your codebook can also be part of your README, rather than
a separate document

<div id="metadata" class="section level3">
<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>Metadata is <em>data about data</em>. They are structured data that
“provide information about the dataset to help people find, understand,
and use your data” (<a
href="https://ies.ed.gov/funding/datasharing_faq.asp">IES</a>). Most of
the time when you hear the term metadata, it will be referring to what I
am going to call project-level metadata.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Project-level metadata is a type of descriptive and legal metadata
that aids in finding your project through internet searches. It is like
the “label of the dataset”. At minimum the information captured should
include who created the data, when the data were created, a title and
description of the data, and a unique identifier for the data. This is
the type of data we discussed capturing earlier within the
<em>General</em>, <em>File</em>, and <em>Access</em> portion of our
<em>README</em> files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Common elements of project-level metadata include:</p>
<p><img src="img/metadata.PNG" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Source: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/datamanagement/documentation">University
of Portland</a></p>
<p>Metadata can also also be categorized further into data-level and
variable-level:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data-level metadata, which might be considered administrative or
technical metadata, focuses more on the details of each dataset such as
instruments used to collect the data and software used to process the
data. Lucikly, creating this metadata requires no extra effort because
this is the exact information captured in sections like
<em>Methodology</em> in your <em>README</em> files above.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable-level metadata, which might be considered structural
metadata, is data about the variables in your dataset. This can be both
incorporated into your data, by adding attributes like variable and
value labels, as well as accounted for externally, and it is includes
all the information discussed earlier in your <em>codebook</em> and/or
<em>data dictionary</em>. This data should also describe how datasets
relate to one another (ex: student dataset is linked to teacher dataset
through tch_id). If your data is qualitative in nature (such as
documents, photos, videos, or sound files), metadata such as
date/time/location, tags/keywords, or measurement information can
sometimes be embedded directly into your files (<a
href="https://libguides.graduateinstitute.ch/rdm/qualitative">IHEID</a>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most notable thing about metadata is that many fields follow
metadata standards that aid in the “retrieving and indexing” of your
data (<a
href="https://data.library.arizona.edu/best-practices/data-documentation-readme-metadata">University
of Arizona</a>). Standards include things such as agreed upon formats,
vocabularies, and structure. For example social science often follows
the Data Documentation Initiative (<a
href="https://ddialliance.org/">DDI</a>) standards. However, (<a
href="https://ies.ed.gov/funding/datasharing_faq.asp">IES</a>) states
that education has no standards and that instead “researchers should
document everything and strive to make notation as interpretable as
possible”. Metadata can either be embedded within data or included in a
separate file such as a README.txt or .pdf file.</p>
<p>If you plan to archive your data, the data repository you plan to use
may have standards in place that you will need to follow. Consult your
repository’s website for detailed information on what is required for
archival. Many universities have archives that are available for use and
IES also has recommended data repositories that can be found <a
href="https://ies.ed.gov/funding/datasharing_faq.asp">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Last you should consider documenting <strong>all</strong> your data
processes to allow for reproducibility. This may fit into one of the
above mentioned documents, or it may be a separate text or markdown
files (such as a README), a syntax file, or even an Excel file. Keep
this document in the folder related to the content and name it
accordingly. Consider tracking things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Versioning (Ex:
<code>README_district-file-changelog.txt</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use version control, this is easy to track through commit
messages or commenting. However, if you do not use software that has
version control, consider keeping a document, such as a changelog, that
tracks differences between files.
<ul>
<li><code>district-data_2020-10-02.xlsx</code>: File received from
District A containing 2019-20 test scores</li>
<li><code>district-data_2020-10-03.xlsx</code>: File received from
District A with 5 additional students added after
<code>district-data_2020-10-02.xlsx</code> was received</li>
<li><code>district-data_2020-10-04.xlsx</code>: File received form
District A with test scores updated for 30 students because errors were
found in <code>district-data_2020-10-03.xlsx</code><br />

</ul></li>
<li><p>Data cleaning plan (Ex:
<code>district_data-cleaning-plan.md</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>This will be discussed more in later trainings, but a written
analysis plan can be helpful to communicate across your team, as a
reminder to your future self, and can also be added to your
documentation or a technical appendix for a report. This plan can be in
a standalone text file, markdown file, or as comments in a syntax file
and should include, in <em>prose</em>, the steps you plan to take to
take your data from raw form to final analysis/clean form. Other people
may refer to this as a <a
href="https://www.teaguehenry.com/strings-not-factors/2021/1/24/data-management-for-researchers-three-terrifying-tales">“Chain
of Processing”</a>. This allows anyone to follow your data cleaning
process, even if they don’t understand your actual code (ex: R or Stata
code).<br />

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The main takeaway is that it is important to document everything. Not
only is it required by funders and by data repositories, as well as
necessary for those submitting data requests, but it is crucial to the
integrity and reproducibility of your project. While you should try to
standardize your documentation as much as possible, don’t get stuck in
the details of the format or the structure. Instead focus on getting the
content, rules, and procedures down before you forget.</p>
<p>Although, <em>publishing data</em> will come in a later module, I did
want to wrap up by saying that when it comes time to publish your data
(whether in a repository or data sharing through your own request
system), plan to include the following documentation with your final
datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>README file (for each dataset) - including the project-level
metadata</li>
<li>Data dictionaries and/or codebooks</li>
</ul>
